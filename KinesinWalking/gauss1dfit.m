% Fitting 1d gaussian to data using lsqcurvefit in Matlab.
% There are two inputs. Both are required, to make it simple. The first is the raw
% data, the second is the x-axis data.
% An estimate will be calculated for initial parameters.
% The output contains the fitted data and the fitted parameters

% measurements

% Estimating the parameters. The center is obtained from the maximum.
% We are assuming that the peaks are all maxima and not minima. The
% standard deviation is obtained by finding the area under the ydata. It
% corresponds to an area that covers 68.3% of the total area from the center

% Need to substract off the constant term. Otherwise the total will be off,
% and so does the percentage. The easy way is to assume that the minimum is
% the constant term. Another way is perhaps take the average of the bottom
% 1% of the data. Or perhaps a better way is to take moving average of the
% whole gaussian, and then just take the smallest value. Let's do this.
% Smooth with 0.5% of the entire length of the data, with a minimum of 5.

% Finding the standard deviation

% In order to find out the area under the curve, we need to take into
% account the width of each element of xdata. For that we can come out with
% a new array for xdata, that corresponds to the width of each point. The
% width of point 6, for example is simply the distance between point 7 and
% point 5, divided by 2. The width of the first and last point is simply
% the width of that point to the point next to it.
